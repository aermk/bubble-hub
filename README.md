- select a washing machine,
- —Åonfirm a reservation,
- delete a reservation.

If the washing machine is not available, it means it has been selected by other users.
If a time slot is unavailable, it means all washing machines in that time slot have been booked by other users.

- The day the user has a reservation is marked with a green mark.
